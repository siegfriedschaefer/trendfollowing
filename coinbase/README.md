I want to test the trend following theory with crypto markets first.

Why?

- crypto is a pure digital asset market. Some argue that there is no "real" value in crypto.
  If this is true than there are fewer influential drivers from the real world that drive the crypto market than in "real" markets. In other words, no needs to find any arguments to describe the
  behaviour of the markets. There are just trends.

- Fees are small if we trade on a central exchange like Coinbase and we need to trade on a real exchange to get financial freedom.

- Later on we switch to a DEX and are independant of any intermediary
